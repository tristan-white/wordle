Feedback should be a 5 character string. Letters should be marked accordingly:
'-' -> letter is not in the target word
'*' -> letter is in the target word but in the incorrect position
'+' -> letter is in the target word and in the correct position
Alternatively, 'b', 'y', and 'g' (representing the black, yellow, and green words from the original Wordle game) can be used instead of '-', '*', '+' respectively
